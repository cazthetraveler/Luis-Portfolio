        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Luis Olmos and I am a graphic designer, photographer, and
          web developer! This is my way of saying that I am now a triple threat.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've attended and graduated from Del Rio High School in 2019, where I
          first was introduced to graphic design. After a year into junior
          college, I decided to go to Texas State Technical College, where I
          then received my Associate's of Applied Science in Digital Media
          Design in 2022. Here is where I got my start into photography and
          videography skills, and an introduction to web development. A year
          after graduating, I decided to learn more about web development, so I
          enrolled and finished a 6-month bootcamp course from the University of
          Texas at San Antonio. I completed the course in February 2024, where I
          will soon receive my certificate of completion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am working as a graphic designer at Ventura Promotional
          Products, here in my hometown.
